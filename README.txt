Detailed Description:
    These are a series of tests that were made using a Natural Language Processing (NLP) type of programming language. Problems solved in Prolog using AI: 
    1) Missionaries & Cannibals 
    2) Family Crossing the Bridge 
    3) Glass Jar 
    4) Maze Problem 
    5) Job Allocation Problem 
    6) Travelling Salesmen Problem 
    7) Map Colouring Problem 
    8) Simple Scheduling Problem 
    9) Cryptanalysis Problem 
    10) Knowledge Representation Problem 
    11) Natural Language Processing Problem 
    12) Decision Trees.

Aims:
    - formally represent problems and knowledge;
    - identify the differences between the various search algorithms and knowledge representation paradigms, by being aware of their advantages and disadvantages;
    - select the appropriate problem solving and KR technique for a particular problem domain;
    - implement solutions to problem solving and KR and understand the key issues involved;
    - understand basic natural language issues and implement simple solutions for syntax parsing and semantic annotation and understanding.

To run: 
    - Use SWI-Prolog or for smaller tests use https://swish.swi-prolog.org/

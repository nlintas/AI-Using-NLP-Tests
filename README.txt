Aims:
    - formally represent problems and knowledge;
    - identify the differences between the various search algorithms and knowledge representation paradigms, by being aware of their advantages and disadvantages;
    - select the appropriate problem solving and KR technique for a particular problem domain;
    - implement solutions to problem solving and KR and understand the key issues involved;
    - understand basic natural language issues and implement simple solutions for syntax parsing and semantic annotation and understanding.

To run: 
    - Use SWI-Prolog or for smaller tests use https://swish.swi-prolog.org/
